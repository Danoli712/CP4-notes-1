		<h1>CSS Notes</h1>
		
		<h2>First part of the course</h2>
		
			<p> CSS stands for cascading style sheets.<br />
			to open the tag use the style attribute.<br />
			to plug in a CSS file you can use the .css like style.css<br />
			the css file and the index.html file need to be linked<br />
			use the < link> element to link the files.<br />
			< link> require the following elements:<br />
					1.href which is the anchor element<br />
					2.type which determines the type of document<br />
					that youre linking it too<br />
					3.rel which describes the relationship between the files<br />
			all paragraph elements will be selected using a CSS selector<br />
			the paragraph elements must be followed by curvy brackets<br />
			CSS has more than tags but also has attributes<br />
			exmple:</p>
			<p> class="brand">Sole Shoe Company</p><br />
			<p>class is an attribute made to "brand"<br />
			to select a html element using CSS put a dot before the elements name<br />
			if an element needs to be styled uniquely then you can give it an id<br />
			to add an id use the id attribute<br />
			to select an id element put a hashtag before the element<br />
			id is the most specific, then classes, and lastly tags<br />
			
			some html elements may require two or more CSS selectors<br />
			!important can be used on specific attributes and wil overide any syle</p><br />
			<p> example: p{color: blue !important;<br />
			}<br />
			.main p{color: red;}</p><br />
			<p> you can write multiple unrelated selectors to give the element<br />
			the same style by seperation the selectors by a coma</p><br />
		
		<h3>introduction To Visual Rules</h3>
		
			<p>to style an HTML element you have to write a CSS declaration inside the body of the selector.<br />
			EXAMPLE:h1{color: blue;<br />
			}<br />
			CSS declarationsconsist of a property and value<br />
			PROPERTY: the property to style the element(size,color,etc)<br />
			VALUE: the value of the property (18px for size, blue for color,etc.)<br />
			to change the font use the font-famiy property<br />
			EXAMPLE: h1{font-family: Garamond;<br />
			}<br />
			when the name of the the font is more than one word put it in quotations<br />
			to cahnge the font size use font-size property<br />
			EXAMPLE: p{font-size: 18px;<br />
			}<br />
			font-weight propety saus if the text is bold or thin<br />
			EXAMPLE: p{font-weight: bold;<br />
			}<br />
			to align text we can use the text-align property: left, center, right<br />
			there are two things that color can affect: foreground, and backround<br />
			foreground is the color of the element<br />
			backround changes the backround of the element<br />
			opacity is used to tell if something is visiple: 100% is fully visible. 0% is invisible<br />
			you can put in a backround image using backroud-image property. it has to be followed by the URL<br />
			height and width can allow you to change the pixels orthe dimensions of a box.<br />
			border surrounds elements.<br />
			borders can be set using width, style,and color.<br />
			1.width determines the thickness of the border(thin,medium,or thick)<br />
			2.style determines the desingn of the border(none, dotted, and solid)<br />
			3.clor determines the color of the border.</p><br />
			<p> EXAMPLE:p {
						 border: 3px solid coral;
						}</p>
					
			<p>a border doesnt have to be square. You can alter it with (border-radius).<br />
			the space between the border and the element is known as padding.<br />
			you can change the amount of padding by using padding then adding an amount of pixels.<br />
			you can be more specific:<br />
									1.PADDING-TOP<br />
									2.PADDING-RIGHT<br />
									3.PADDING-BOTTOM<br />
									4.PADDING-LEFT<br />
			you can declare the padding in one line in clockwise order.</p><br />
			<p>magins determin the space outside the box.<br />
			you can be more specific:<br />
									1.margin-top<br />
									2.margin-bottom<br />
									3.margin-right<br />
									4.margin-left<br />
			you can write margins on all 4 sides in one line: clockwise.<br />
			margin can also be used to center content.<br />
			<br />
			1.min-width: makes sure of a minimum width of an elemts box.<br />
			2.max-width: makes sure that theres a maximum width to an elements box.<br />
			<br />
			1.max-height:ensures a maximum height for the box<br />
			2.min-width: ensures a minimum height for the box</p><br />
			
			<p>The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. It can be set to one of the following values:<br />
			hidden:when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.<br />
			scroll:when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element's box so that the rest of the content can be 	viewed by scrolling.<br />
			visible:when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. note, this is the default value.<br />
			
			Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.<br />
			The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:<br />
			hidden:hides an element.<br />
			visible:displays an element.</p>
		
		<h4>Changing the Box model</h4>
		
			<p>box-sizing: controls the box dimensions< br/>
			border-box: not affected by padding or thickness and is the new value for the box.</p><br />
		
		<h5>Display and positioning</h5>
		
			<p>position: put the element in three different positions:<br />
				relative: its position in relation of the default position<br />
				absolute: element can be pu on any part of the page, but will disapear when scrolled<br />
				fixed: can be put on any part of the page but will stay in view.<br />
			z-index: how far back or how close it will show.<br />
			float: how far left or right the element will be<br />
			clear the clear property will allow you to have nothing on the side of the element.</p><br />
