<!DOCTYPE html> must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.\
t indicates to the browser that you will use HTML in the document, but it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.
Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. 
Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page
The browser displays the title of the page because the title can be specified directly inside of the <head> element, by using a <title> tag.
Before we can add content that a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. 
Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.
The line break element <br /> is one example of a self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code. 
The result is a line break in the browser.
