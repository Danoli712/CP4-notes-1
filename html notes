-<!DOCTYPE html> must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.\
-t indicates to the browser that you will use HTML in the document, but it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.
-Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. 
-Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
-The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page
-The browser displays the title of the page because the title can be specified directly inside of the <head> element, by using a <title> tag.
-Before we can add content that a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. 
-Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.
-The line break element <br /> is one example of a self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code. 
-The result is a line break in the browser.
-  The result is a line break in the browser.
-There are 2 tolls that can be used to see relationships between the elements (whitespace, indentation)
-browsers will ignore whitespaces. 
-indentations make your code easier to read
-comment begin with: <!-- and ends with-->
-comments help the reader to understand the code and to experiment.
-exemple:<!-- <p> Test Code</p> -->
-exeple of everything:
-<p><!DOCTYPE html>
-<html>
-  <head>
-  	<title>My Coding Journey</title>
-  </head>
-  <body>
-    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
-  </body>
-</html></p>
-
-in HTML there a six diferent types of headings. They are ordered for big to small:
-<h1>
-<h2>
-<h3>
-<h4>
-<h5>
-<h6>
-exemple: <h1>BREAKING NEWS</h1>
-to add text in HTML there are three things that you can use:paragraph,div,span
-to use paragraph which is to write normal blocks of text its <p>
-to use div which is used to divide documents its <div>
-to use span which are small peices of text its <span>
-to organize and describe content you can us <em> and <strong>
-<em> will put the text in italic
-<strong> will put the text in bold
-to create an list in no particular order use the tag <ul>
-to describe an item in a list use the tag <li>
- exemple:
-<ul>
-  <li>Limes</li>
-  <li>Tortillas</li>
-  <li>Chicken</li>
-</ul>
-to make an ordered list use the<ol> tag
-to add an image use the <img> tag
-it needs src to work an src is the URL of the website
-to put in a video use the <video> tag
-the video tag also needs an src
-to add links to a website use the <a> tag
-exemple: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
-href is used to make a file path or you wont be able to link the websites.
-if you want th link to open in onother window the use the <target> tag
-the <target> tag requires the _blank to function
-exemple:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
-nav is used to organize your page
-to make a table use the <table> tag
-to add rows use the <tr> tag
-to add in formation use the <td> tag
-to add title to your graph use the <th> tag
-the value row makes it clear that the headig is a row
-col makes it clear that the heading is for a clomn
-to put in borders in your  graph you should use the border attribute
-to span clomns use the colspan attribute
-to span rows use the rowspan attribute
-you can section off elements by using the <tbody> tag
-to section of the table head, use the <thead> tag
-the bottom half of a table can be cut off by using the <tfoof> element

    <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>

    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>
